              Sri Sri Gurukuls have a holistic approach to education. The primary subject is the Vedas. Students specialize in one branch of Vedas, learning as per a specific Shakha Sampradaya. Extracurricular activities train the students in the arts, Yoga, meditation, music and cooking. Modern subjects keep them up to date in communication and general knowledge, so that they become pillars of society.
